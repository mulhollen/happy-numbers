<!--
Write out 143 happy numbers up to 1,000. 
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, 
and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers).
